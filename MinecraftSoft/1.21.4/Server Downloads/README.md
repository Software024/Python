***Please note: This server setup is only compatible with Minecraft Java Edition.***

If you want to run a Minecraft multiplayer server by yourself things get kind of involved ([see this wiki article for a tutorial](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server)). First make sure you can use java from the command line. On Linux and macOS this should already be set up but on Windows you might have to tinker with the PATH environment variable.

*After you have downloaded the server (java_server-1.21.4.jar), run it with the following commands in Command Prompt (make sure you have a JDK higher than Java SE 17):*

`cd "the/directory/you/installed/the/server/file/to"
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.1.21.4.jar nogui`

*Should you want to start the server with its graphical user interface you can leave out the "nogui" part.*
